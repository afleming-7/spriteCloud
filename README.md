This repository contains automated **UI and API tests** for:

- [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) – UI tests
- [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) – API tests

Tests are implemented in **JavaScript** using **Playwright**, with a **Page Object Model (POM)** for UI tests.

## Running Tests

1. **Run all tests:**

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. **Run a single test file:**

   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/ui/Checkout.spec.js
   ```

3. **Run UI tests only:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

4. **Run API tests only:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:api
   ```

5. **Run Cucumber demo tests only:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:cucumber
   ```

6. **Run Browser-specific tests:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:chrome
   npm run test:firefox
   ```

7. **Generate reports:**

   ```bash
   npm run report
   ```

8. **Clean reports folder:**

   ```bash
   npm run clean:reports
   ```

9. **Runs Typescript Verification:**

   ```bash

## Reports

- **Allure** is used for reporting.
- Reports include:
  - Screenshots for UI tests
  - Logs
  - API responses
- GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run tests automatically on push or pull requests.

---

## Assumptions

- SauceDemo credentials: `standard_user / secret_sauce`
- Checkout total price and item prices are based on current website data.
- API requests use the public [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) endpoints.
- Maximum delay for delayed request test is **3 seconds**.

---

## AI Usage

- Some test skeletons and this documentation were generated with **OpenAI ChatGPT** to accelerate development.
- All logic, validations, and assertions were **reviewed and implemented manually**.
